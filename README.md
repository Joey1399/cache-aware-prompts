# cache-aware-prompts

cache-aware-prompts helps you assemble prompts in a way that maximizes prefix-cache hits (stable ordering, deterministic serialization, strict separation of static vs dynamic sections). It can diff two prompt builds to show exactly what changed and where caching is likely to break. Built to pair with API-side prompt caching for lower latency and lower input costs on repeated prefixes (tools, policies, schemas).
